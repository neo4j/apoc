The examples in this section are based on a sample graph with 10000 nodes, each with 50 relationships
with the label "Node" and Type "CONNECTED_TO".

The query below calculates the cross product of shortest paths for every pair of nodes.

[source,cypher]
----
match (n:Node), (m:Node)
WHERE n <> m
match path = shortestpath((n)-[:CONNECTED_TO*]-(m))
RETURN n, m, length(path) AS path;
----

This query returns 999,000 rows, but it takes a while to return all of those rows.

We can use the `apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed` procedure to return the paths computed within a threshold defined in ms.
We can return the results computed within 100ms, by running the query below:

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed("match (n:Node), (m:Node)
WHERE n <> m
match path = shortestpath((n)-[:CONNECTED_TO*]-(m))
RETURN n, m, length(path) AS path", {}, 100)
YIELD value
RETURN value.n.uuid, value.m.uuid, value.path;
----
